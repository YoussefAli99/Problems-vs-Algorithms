In this problem I am supposed to implement the search algorithm in the rotated sorted array. As I have to find the given number and I have to do it in log(n) time. To find the pivot from where it is rotated is I have found the pivot first i.e. by how much amount the sorted array is shifted. Then in the two divided part I have implemented the binary search directly.

Time Complexity: O(log(n)) Space Complexity: O(1)
